    Data Fixer Upper (or DFU for short) is a library for creating transformations between structures regardless of the
    specific schemas or storage formats the structures use. Users of DFU will generally use two sets of types:
    the serialization types and the data fix types. An overview of the relevant packages is given below, but see the
    documentation of those packages and types for more details.

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Serialization:</strong>These types are located in the {@link com.mojang.serialization} package,
        and provide a way to define a transformation of objects of some type to and from an arbitrary hierarchical
        serialized form.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Data fixing:</strong>These types are located in the {@link com.mojang.datafixers} package,
        and provide a way to map the value or format of part of a structure to another value or format. This is
        achieved using optics.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Users typically will not need to use the types in the remaining packages, but they are still shown here for
    convenience (or masochism).
