    Help me, for I have undertaken DFU.

            I have lost my sanity. I have stared into the black abyss. I have seen interfaces with too many methods.
            There are too many to count. They laugh, for they are similar and yet so slightly different. They laugh in
            discordant voices.

        This is Mojang's Open Source software. An eldritch abomination: a mad creature unleashed raw upon this world.
        From the minds of point free, type theory, and monoids heralds a monster unlike any I have ever seen. I have
        seen it with my own eyes. I have shone light into the darkness that is DFU and that light cannot be put out!
    </em></p>
    <p><em>
        The endless teeth! Grinning like a Cheshire Cat! Snacking on the souls of lesser beings! May Haskell Curry
        protect me. A mere programmer cannot take this beast. No, this beast cannot be tamed. It requires an exorcist.
    </em></p>
    <p><em>
        I descend. I know not where this road shall take me, but the creature beckons and I must follow. The creature
        with a thousand teeth and a thousand Mu. Oh, Mojang! Take back your abomination! Renounce the life you have
        given this horror! This slow and lumbering beast demands the blood of many. Such a sacrifice I cannot fulfill.
        I am swift, but not enough.

    Data Fixer Upper (or DFU for short) is a library for creating transformations between structures, regardless of the
    specific schemas or storage formats the structures use. Users of DFU will generally use two sets of types:
    the serialization types and the data fix types. An overview of the relevant packages is given below, but see the
    documentation of those packages and types for more details.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Serialization:</strong>These types are located in the {@link com.mojang.serialization} package,
        and provide a way to define a transformation of objects of some type to and from an arbitrary hierarchical
        serialized form.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Data fixing:</strong>These types are located in the {@link com.mojang.datafixers} package,
        and provide a way to map the value or format of part of a structure to another value or format. This is
        achieved using optics.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Users typically will not need to use the types in the remaining packages, but they are still shown here for
    convenience (or masochism).
